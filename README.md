<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
For many students, owning a car is an expense they can't afford, making it difficult for them to get to school or work. Uber or other ride-sharing services can be a pricey alternative, especially for longer distances. However, a new carpooling platform for students attending the University of North Texas could provide a cost-effective solution. By connecting with other students traveling to the same destination, users can split the cost of the trip and save money. The platform also allows students to post ride requests or offer to carpool with others, giving them more flexibility and control over their transportation needs. In addition, the app offers the option to schedule rides ahead of time, which guarantees a ride for passengers and allows drivers to plan their trip accordingly. Overall, the carpooling website serves as a win-win solution for UNT students by offering a ride-sharing option and an opportunity for drivers to offset some of their expenses.

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

 - [X] **Register as a Driver:** Users can create a driver account by providing their personal information, vehicle information, and driver's license information.
 - [X] **Register as a Passenger:** Users can create a passenger account by providing their personal information and contact details.
 - [X] **Login as a Driver:** Registered drivers can log in to their account using their email/username and password.
 - [X] **Login as a Passenger:** Registered passengers can log in to their account using their email/username and password.
 - [X] **Post a Ride Request:** Passengers can post a ride request by providing their pick-up and drop-off locations, date and time, and any additional notes.
 - [X] **Accept/Validate Ride Request:** When a driver accepts a ride request, they will be taken to a validation page where they can confirm the pick-up and drop-off locations and the date and time of the ride. They can also chat with the passenger to confirm any additional details.
 - [X] **Accepting an Available Ride:** Drivers can browse available rides in their area and accept them if they are available.
 - [ ] **Payments:** Once the ride is completed, passengers will be charged and drivers will receive payment. Payment information will be stored in the passenger's dashboard.
 - [ ] **Chat Feature:** Passengers and drivers can communicate with each other through the chat feature on the website. This will be useful for confirming ride details and making any necessary changes.
 - [X] **Ride History:** Passengers can view their ride history, including the pick-up and drop-off locations, date and time, and the driver's information.
 - [ ] **Cancellation of Ride:** Passengers can cancel a ride request before it is accepted by a driver. Once a ride is accepted by a driver, the passenger will be charged a cancellation fee. If a driver cancels a ride, they will not receive payment for that ride and their acceptance rate will be affected.
